              Self-care involves deliberate actions you take to care for your physical, mental, and emotional health. 
              It&apos;s not selfishâ€”it&apos;s necessary for your overall well-being and academic success.

                Self-care is especially important during your educational journey. Research shows that students who practice 
                regular self-care experience reduced stress, improved concentration, better academic performance, and greater 
                resilience when facing challenges.
